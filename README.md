This is the [Developer Intern Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKRywXQLZWOqVOHC4JkF3LqdpO3Llpfk_CkZPR8bjak/edit) for SU21 Internships. This online repository was made with `flask` and `sqlite3` and allows for the buying and selling (singly and in bulk) of images at various prices set by the user. It is written as an application for a store owner, so you can buy images at a wholesale price and sell them at your selling price. You can also add and remove images as you see fit, and edit pricing information.

To run, simply clone the repository and run `python main.py`.
